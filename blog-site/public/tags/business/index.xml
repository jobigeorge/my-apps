      <description>As a practitioner, I get this question a lot of time from the newly minted CEOs. They understand the math behind their company’s primary Go-To-Market (GTM) motion. And also might have built a working model on how to scale if the product-market fit emerges. Most of the time, it goes something like this - For a top-down enterprise selling motion - “If I hire X Sales/SE/Ops guys, they can get me to Y revenue, if there is more demand I will just replicate and use a bigger multiplier”.</description>

      <title>Rushing to Cloud Marketplaces is not a strategy</title>

      <description>For software vendors it is not just about getting on the catalog but also about building a product that maximizes the massive channel these cloud marketplaces open up
Cloud Marketplaces from mega cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS and Google GCP are in now, AWS Marketplace alone has 7500+ listing and over a million subscribers. Cloud is fundamentally transforming the supply chain of software and services. For any independent software vendor (ISV) today it is hard to ignore the havoc these cloud platforms are causing to their established way of building, marketing and selling software.</description>

      <description>Recently read about the famous &amp;ldquo;Sampling Case&amp;rdquo; that involved George Clinton. Yes the same George Clinton who ruled the 1970-1982 urban dance floors, mixing blues with earth-shaking bottom, cosmic consciousness, and some of the best guitar leads in dance music. He is also credited with giving birth to funk.
It is very interesting to see the parallels between music industry evolution and what virtualization driven digitization is doing to the computer industry.</description>

      <title>Digitization of Desktop </title>

      <description>Virtualization driven desktop consolidations are very much in news now. VMware with VDI got it started but very quickly others are rallying and catching on to the bandwagon. Citrix, Microsoft and others though late to the party are not sitting idle and are quickly catching up. Recent news on the licensing changes from Microsoft to support Vista Enterprise Centralized Desktops (VECD) looks like the tipping point for adoption of desktop virtualization by mainstream.</description>

      <title>PCs and web2.0 : Part 2 PCs the perfect Interaction Engines</title>

      <description>Last week I talked about how the PCs existing role is being threatened by the evolving push towards services based applications. There is a widespread fear that web2.0 and SaaS will finally kill the thick Moore&amp;rsquo;s law driven PC and we all will be either working of dumb terminals or the cell phone size devices that will run all our applications. Certainly skeptics and realists are arriving and last weeks blog by John Milan talked about how Google&amp;rsquo;s desktop based application strategy is evolving.</description>

      <title>PCs and web2.0 : Part 1 What made PCs so successful</title>
      <link>https://jobigeorge.netlify.app/2006/10/19/personal-computers-part1/</link>

      <description>There is enough written about the success of the PCs, and the overall impact it has had over decades. PCs not only are attributed to increased productivity, economic gains and creation of the Information Technology business. I don’t have to delve into it very much. What I am trying to do is look at PCs and their role in the changing landscape of services based application, call it web2.0, SOA or some flavor of SaaS.</description>

      <title>Intel: Meet Darwin</title>

      <description>Pretty well put by Geoff Moore. A great guidance and lesson for anybody trying to be a platform player.
 Dealing with Darwin demands counter-intuitive actions, specifically when the environment has changed in some fundamental way that invalidates one’s traditional source of competitive advantage. … The competitive advantage position is changed. It remains to be seen if Intel can adapt and define competitive advantages in adjacencies.
This past week Intel surprised analysts with the latest in a set of uncharacteristically weak performances, especially in comparison with AMD.</description>
