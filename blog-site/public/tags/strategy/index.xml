      <description>For software vendors it is not just about getting on the catalog but also about building a product that maximizes the massive channel these cloud marketplaces open up
Cloud Marketplaces from mega cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS and Google GCP are in now, AWS Marketplace alone has 7500+ listing and over a million subscribers. Cloud is fundamentally transforming the supply chain of software and services. For any independent software vendor (ISV) today it is hard to ignore the havoc these cloud platforms are causing to their established way of building, marketing and selling software.</description>

      <title>iAd - Did Google just hold a red cloth to charging bull?</title>

      <description>With iAd now officially announced and details starting to trickle in, the fight is officially on. Google and Apple are now in direct competition and this time it is in Google&amp;rsquo;s home turf. Forbes has a good take on what are missing in the iAd efforts.
The 4 keys ones are -
 Creative agencies build ads in Flash. There is no comparable tool for creating HTML5 creatives. As a media agency (e.</description>

      <description>Google is finally giving more clarity on the business models for device vendors and the service providers. The NY Times article mention three options -
  The obligation-free option: Fre Android, load onto their devices and provide access to as many or as few apps as they want. No preload popular Google applications, like Gmail or Google calendar.
  The small strings option: Same as Option 1, except that manufacturers sign a distribution agreement to include on the phone Google applications.</description>

      <description>Yes Apple has done it again and as usual I am a big fan of Steve (who isn&amp;rsquo;t :-)&amp;hellip;
3G iPhones are going to be here soon and the evolution of platform continues. The difference between Apple and Google is so visible&amp;hellip;
Apple sells benefits, while everyone else sells features. Since average consumers are only interested in benefits: calling someone, texting someone, photo galleries, video playback, maps, web browsing, email, etc.</description>

      <description>Today there is a great post by Geofferey Helt at Minnyvale on how Steve transformed Apple..In summary..
The fundamental challenge facing the leadership team at Apple is not about strategy, but rather capacity. The question that stands in the way of its heroic future is: How do we redesign the organization of our business to deliver on the following interconnected fronts?
 Doubling the number of Apple stores to facilitate broader adoption.</description>

      <description>Now more than a week has passed since &amp;ldquo;iPhone&amp;rdquo; release and hopefully we can start looking beyond Jesus Phone. Looks like things are getting back to normal and Apple is also ready to focus back on iPod. It is a good time to talk about things beyond iPhone. One of the key capabilities that Apple had been quietly rolling out into it&amp;rsquo;s products and is very rarely talked about is the networking platform - &amp;ldquo;Bonjour&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Recently read about the famous &amp;ldquo;Sampling Case&amp;rdquo; that involved George Clinton. Yes the same George Clinton who ruled the 1970-1982 urban dance floors, mixing blues with earth-shaking bottom, cosmic consciousness, and some of the best guitar leads in dance music. He is also credited with giving birth to funk.
It is very interesting to see the parallels between music industry evolution and what virtualization driven digitization is doing to the computer industry.</description>

      <description>Virtualization driven desktop consolidations are very much in news now. VMware with VDI got it started but very quickly others are rallying and catching on to the bandwagon. Citrix, Microsoft and others though late to the party are not sitting idle and are quickly catching up. Recent news on the licensing changes from Microsoft to support Vista Enterprise Centralized Desktops (VECD) looks like the tipping point for adoption of desktop virtualization by mainstream.</description>

      <title>How IBM leverages Open Source</title>

      <description>Dana Blankenhorn recently blogged about IBMs reaction to Sun’s Java plan and their approach to open source ecosystem. I think Dana summarizes it very well. IBM believes Open Source is a great technology floor on which others and even IBM builds. But as Dana points out, it is naive to treat IBM a Solutions and Services company with rest of the software industry players who are primarily software vendors like Oracle, SAP, RedHat and Microsoft.</description>

      <title>PCs and web2.0 : Part 2 PCs the perfect Interaction Engines</title>
      <link>https://jobigeorge.netlify.app/2006/11/05/personal-computer-part2/</link>

      <description>Last week I talked about how the PCs existing role is being threatened by the evolving push towards services based applications. There is a widespread fear that web2.0 and SaaS will finally kill the thick Moore&amp;rsquo;s law driven PC and we all will be either working of dumb terminals or the cell phone size devices that will run all our applications. Certainly skeptics and realists are arriving and last weeks blog by John Milan talked about how Google&amp;rsquo;s desktop based application strategy is evolving.</description>

      <title>PCs and web2.0 : Part 1 What made PCs so successful</title>

      <description>There is enough written about the success of the PCs, and the overall impact it has had over decades. PCs not only are attributed to increased productivity, economic gains and creation of the Information Technology business. I don’t have to delve into it very much. What I am trying to do is look at PCs and their role in the changing landscape of services based application, call it web2.0, SOA or some flavor of SaaS.</description>

      <description>Pretty well put by Geoff Moore. A great guidance and lesson for anybody trying to be a platform player.
 Dealing with Darwin demands counter-intuitive actions, specifically when the environment has changed in some fundamental way that invalidates one’s traditional source of competitive advantage. … The competitive advantage position is changed. It remains to be seen if Intel can adapt and define competitive advantages in adjacencies.
This past week Intel surprised analysts with the latest in a set of uncharacteristically weak performances, especially in comparison with AMD.</description>
