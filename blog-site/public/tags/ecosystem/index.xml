      <description>As a practitioner, I get this question a lot of time from the newly minted CEOs. They understand the math behind their company’s primary Go-To-Market (GTM) motion. And also might have built a working model on how to scale if the product-market fit emerges. Most of the time, it goes something like this - For a top-down enterprise selling motion - “If I hire X Sales/SE/Ops guys, they can get me to Y revenue, if there is more demand I will just replicate and use a bigger multiplier”.</description>

      <title>iAd - Did Google just hold a red cloth to charging bull?</title>

      <description>With iAd now officially announced and details starting to trickle in, the fight is officially on. Google and Apple are now in direct competition and this time it is in Google&amp;rsquo;s home turf. Forbes has a good take on what are missing in the iAd efforts.
The 4 keys ones are -
 Creative agencies build ads in Flash. There is no comparable tool for creating HTML5 creatives. As a media agency (e.</description>

      <description>Google is finally giving more clarity on the business models for device vendors and the service providers. The NY Times article mention three options -
  The obligation-free option: Fre Android, load onto their devices and provide access to as many or as few apps as they want. No preload popular Google applications, like Gmail or Google calendar.
  The small strings option: Same as Option 1, except that manufacturers sign a distribution agreement to include on the phone Google applications.</description>

      <description>Now more than a week has passed since &amp;ldquo;iPhone&amp;rdquo; release and hopefully we can start looking beyond Jesus Phone. Looks like things are getting back to normal and Apple is also ready to focus back on iPod. It is a good time to talk about things beyond iPhone. One of the key capabilities that Apple had been quietly rolling out into it&amp;rsquo;s products and is very rarely talked about is the networking platform - &amp;ldquo;Bonjour&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Virtualization driven desktop consolidations are very much in news now. VMware with VDI got it started but very quickly others are rallying and catching on to the bandwagon. Citrix, Microsoft and others though late to the party are not sitting idle and are quickly catching up. Recent news on the licensing changes from Microsoft to support Vista Enterprise Centralized Desktops (VECD) looks like the tipping point for adoption of desktop virtualization by mainstream.</description>

      <title>How IBM leverages Open Source</title>

      <description>Dana Blankenhorn recently blogged about IBMs reaction to Sun’s Java plan and their approach to open source ecosystem. I think Dana summarizes it very well. IBM believes Open Source is a great technology floor on which others and even IBM builds. But as Dana points out, it is naive to treat IBM a Solutions and Services company with rest of the software industry players who are primarily software vendors like Oracle, SAP, RedHat and Microsoft.</description>

      <title>PCs and web2.0 : Part 2 PCs the perfect Interaction Engines</title>

      <description>Last week I talked about how the PCs existing role is being threatened by the evolving push towards services based applications. There is a widespread fear that web2.0 and SaaS will finally kill the thick Moore&amp;rsquo;s law driven PC and we all will be either working of dumb terminals or the cell phone size devices that will run all our applications. Certainly skeptics and realists are arriving and last weeks blog by John Milan talked about how Google&amp;rsquo;s desktop based application strategy is evolving.</description>

      <title>PCs and web2.0 : Part 1 What made PCs so successful</title>
      <link>https://jobigeorge.netlify.app/2006/10/19/personal-computers-part1/</link>

      <description>There is enough written about the success of the PCs, and the overall impact it has had over decades. PCs not only are attributed to increased productivity, economic gains and creation of the Information Technology business. I don’t have to delve into it very much. What I am trying to do is look at PCs and their role in the changing landscape of services based application, call it web2.0, SOA or some flavor of SaaS.</description>

      <description>Pretty well put by Geoff Moore. A great guidance and lesson for anybody trying to be a platform player.
 Dealing with Darwin demands counter-intuitive actions, specifically when the environment has changed in some fundamental way that invalidates one’s traditional source of competitive advantage. … The competitive advantage position is changed. It remains to be seen if Intel can adapt and define competitive advantages in adjacencies.
This past week Intel surprised analysts with the latest in a set of uncharacteristically weak performances, especially in comparison with AMD.</description>
