[MeshCentral](http://meshcentral.com/) is an experimental service from Intel Software and Services Group. The service concept is brain child of brilliant researcher [Ylian Saint-Hilaire](https://twitter.com/MeshCentral). I joined Yllian early this year as the business guy to bring MESHCentral technologies to market. In nutshell MeshCentral is a very simple concept of allowing easier/scalable (P2P) way to connect edge nodes (PC, embedded CE, routers etc..) to Cloud Services that allow secure discovery with ability to send authorized events and deliver secure control messages.

Above is the current architecture. Currently we have experimental service launched that anybody can sign up and start creating there own private meshed nodes. We support Sleep & Wake-on LAN, Computer Monitoring, Computer Management, Managing from Browser, Smartphone's including JS based remote shells and video. On Cloud services side we have done OpenID and oAuth integration allowing Google/Yahoo SSO and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/meshcentral) updates for nodes..

There is great [podcast](http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4731.html) that Ylian recently did with IT Conversations. It lays out some of our vision and plans for the future. Check it out at - http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4731.html
