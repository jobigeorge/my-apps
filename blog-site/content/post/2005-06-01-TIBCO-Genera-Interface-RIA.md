Check out Jon Udell's screencast showing a demo of the TIBCO General
Interface, a JavaScript/DHTML framework for building Internet Apps.

* [Screencast: ](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/tibco.html) (8 mins.)

The tool is built using a javascript based toolkit. Very cool and looks very detailed.  I am waiting to play with it once it is out.
My team did a similar framework for WebSphere Application Developer 5.1.2, called the Browser Framework and JSF Javascript Emitters. I will cover that in another post.
