Check out Jon Udell's screencast showing a demo of the TIBCO General
Interface, a JavaScript/DHTML framework for building Internet Apps.

The tool is built using a javascript based toolkit. Very cool and looks very detailed. Waiting to play with it once it is out. 

My team did similar framework for WebSphere Application Developer 5.1.2. which was called the Browser Framework and JSF Javascript Emitters. I will cover that in another post.
